Lets suppose you have your non-retina and retina icons under app/assets/images/icons and app/assets/images/retina-icons respectively.

  Important: if a non-retina icon is 16x16 then the retina icon must be 32x32. If you don't follow this your icons won't look aligned.

In some part of your css put this line of code:

  +sprite-up("icons/*.png", "retina-icons/*.png")

  Important: you can generate as many sprites as you need as long as you have your icons separated

  +sprite-up("icons/*.png", "retina-icons/*.png")
  +sprite-up("home-icons/*.png", "home-retina-icons/*.png", "home")

The css output will be:

  /* ... */

  .icons-beatiful-icon {
    background-image: url("/images/icons-s6702f5f04e.png");
    /* ... */
  }
  @media (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3 / 2), (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {
    .icons-beatiful-icon {
      background-image: url("/images/retina-icons-se1e882e708.png");
      /* ... */
    }
  }

  /* ... */

  .home-pretty-icon {
    background-image: url("/images/home-icons-scb1395e685.png");
    /* ... */
  }
  @media (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3 / 2), (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {
    .home-pretty-icon {
      background-image: url("/images/home-retina-icons-sc376afb714.png");
      /* ... */
    }
  }

  /* ... */

You don't need to create any class for any icon, they are autogenerated. The only thing you'll need to maintain are your images. Remove then we they are not necesary, sprite-up will take care of the sprites and your css will remain untouched.
